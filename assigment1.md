-Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?

The only similarity between these two notions is that both spreadsheets and databases can store data in a tabular format. Numeric and textual values are arranged across columns/fields and rows/records.

A spreadsheet is a table or a collection of tables, so is the database. However, databases can store a huge number of tables compared to spreadsheets. This is the main difference out of many more, which weâ€™re going to discuss below.

Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle large amounts of information that cannot be managed in a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets have record limitations, while databases do not. Compared to databases, spreadsheets can require large amounts of hard drive space to store data. When a spreadsheet has many fields or large amounts of data (1000 rows), the spreadsheet can be difficult to read.

Updates to databases are typically easier than spreadsheets, especially if the same information is held in multiple records or in multiple spreadsheets.

Although data in spreadsheets can be sorted and filtered, a database has extensive query functionality that can retrieve all records that match selected criteria, cross-reference records from multiple tables, and perform complex batch calculations across multiple tables.

Data errors in spreadsheets are difficult to prevent and efficiently identify.
Also, it is much easier to accidentally overwrite or delete data in a spreadsheet than in a database. The larger and more complex the spreadsheet, the greater the chance that data will be accidentally modified and links broken.



-What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)?

Advantages and Disadvantages of Databases

Advantages                                   
-Large volume of data
-Backup and recovery of data
-Data security
-Shareability and multi-access to data
Disadvantages                                   
-Cost of converting data files into a database
-Cost of setup and maintenance
-Cost of querying

Spreadsheets Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages                                   
-Free or low cost
-Data formatting and visualization
-Calculation ability
-Preset function for data manipulation
Disadvantages                                   
-Limited shareability
-Security
-Poor performance with large volumes of data
-Scalability
